                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p>The journey of Little Lemon is one that blends cultures, experiences, and a shared love of good food. Adrian and Mario, despite their different backgrounds, were united by one thing: their deep-rooted connection to food. Raised in households where cooking was a celebration of life, their early memories are steeped in the smells of slow-cooked meats, fresh vegetables, tangy olive oil, and the warmth of homemade bread. As step-brothers, Adrian and Mario may have grown up in different cities, but their love of Mediterranean cuisine was a bond that connected them from the start. Their shared experiences of family gatherings, Mediterranean-inspired dinners, and spontaneous cooking lessons were the foundation for what would later become Little Lemon.</p>
                    <p>After years of honing their culinary skills and exploring Mediterranean food culture, they finally decided to combine their passions and open a restaurant where they could bring these authentic, bold flavors to Chicago. Named after the little lemon tree in Adrian’s grandmother’s garden — a symbol of growth, life, and family — Little Lemon is a tribute to everything that food means to them. It’s about the moments we share with those we love, the memories we create over a meal, and the excitement that comes from exploring new tastes and dishes.</p>
                    <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>At Little Lemon, we believe that food should be simple, fresh, and full of flavor. We take great pride in serving Mediterranean dishes made from the finest ingredients, sourced both locally and from trusted suppliers across the globe. Each dish on our menu is carefully crafted to bring out the natural flavors of the ingredients, inspired by the cuisines of Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, Spain, and North Africa. We don’t just serve food; we serve a story with every dish. Whether it’s a plate of hummus passed down from Mario’s mother’s kitchen or a grilled octopus recipe that Adrian perfected during his travels to the Greek Islands, every item has its own tale to tell. Our menu is a celebration of Mediterranean cuisine in all its vibrant diversity — from fresh salads bursting with seasonal vegetables to tender lamb chops marinated with herbs and spices, and from seafood dishes kissed by the sea to decadent desserts infused with honey and citrus.</p>
                    <h3>Our Ingredients</h3>
                    <p>The cornerstone of our philosophy is fresh, high-quality ingredients. The Mediterranean diet is known for its use of fresh vegetables, lean meats, olive oil, grains, and seafood. We work closely with local farms and suppliers to ensure that we are always serving the best seasonal produce, and we bring in specialty items directly from Mediterranean countries to ensure authenticity. Each of our dishes is made from scratch, right in our kitchen. From hand-rolling the pita bread to slow-roasting lamb for hours, we believe that the love and care put into the preparation of food is just as important as the ingredients themselves.</p>
                    <h3>Join Us</h3>
                    <p>We invite you to come as you are, to relax, to laugh, and to savor every bite. Whether you're here for a casual dinner or a grand celebration, Little Lemon is more than just a place to eat — it's a place to connect, to enjoy the company of friends, and to experience the best of Mediterranean cuisine in the heart of Chicago.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for being part of our journey. We can’t wait to share our passion with you, one delicious dish at a time.</p>
